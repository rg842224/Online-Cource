<h1 class="center">C++ Programming Language</h1>
<p class="black">What is C++ ?</p>
<p>C++ is a general purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural and generic programming.
C++ is a middle-level language, as it encapsulates both high and low level language features.</p>
<p class="black">Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)</p>
<p>
C++ supports the object-oriented programming, the four major pillar of object oriented programming used in C++ are:
1. Inheritance
2. Polymorphism
3. Encapsulation
4. Abstraction
5. Standard Libraries
</p>
<p class="black">Standard C++ programming is divided into three important parts:</p>
<p>The core library includes the data types, variables and literals, etc.
The standard library includes the set of functions manipulating strings, files, etc.
The Standard Template Library (STL) includes the set of methods manipulating a data structure.
</p>
<p class="black">Usage of C++</p>
<p>By the help of C++ programming language, we can develop different types of secured and robust applications:

1. Window application
2. Client-Server application
3. Device drivers
4. Embedded firmware etc
</p>
<p class="black">C++ Features</p>
<p>C++ is object oriented programming language. It provides a lot of features that are given below:
1. Simple
2. Machine Independent or Portable
3. Mid-level programming language
4. Structured programming language
5. Rich Library
6. Memory Management
7. Fast Speed
8. Pointers
9. Recursion
10. Extensible
11. Object Oriented
12. Compiler based
</p>
<p class="black">
1) Simple:</p>
        <p>C++ is a simple language in the sense that it provides structured approach (to break the problem into parts), rich set of library functions, data types etc.</p>
<p class="black">2) Machine Independent or Portable:</p>
        <p>Unlike assembly language, c programs can be executed in many machines with little bit or no change. But it is not platform-independent.</p>
<p class="black">3) Mid-level programming language:</p>
        <p>C++ is also used to do low level programming. It is used to develop system applications such as kernel, driver etc. It also supports the feature of high level language. That is why it is known as mid-level language.</p>
<p class="black">4) Structured programming language: </p>
        <p>C++ is a structured programming language in the sense that we can break the program into parts using functions. So, it is easy to understand and modify.</p>
<p class="black">5) Rich Library:</p>
       <p>C++ provides a lot of inbuilt functions that makes the development fast.</p>
<p class="black">6) Memory Management:</p>
     <p>It supports the feature of dynamic memory allocation. In C++ language, we can free the allocated memory at any time by calling the free() function.</p>
<p class="black">7) Speed:</p>
     <p>The compilation and execution time of C++ language is fast.</p>
<p class="black">8) Pointer:</p>
     <p>C++ provides the feature of pointers. We can directly interact with the memory by using the pointers. We can use pointers for memory, structures, functions, array etc.</p>
<p class="black">9) Recursion:</p>
     <p>In C++, we can call the function within the function. It provides code reusability for every function.</p>
<p class="black">10) Extensible:</p>
      <p>C++ language is extensible because it can easily adopt new features.</p>
<p>class="black">11) Object Oriented:</p>
     <p> C++ is object oriented programming language. OOPs makes development and maintenance easier where as in Procedure-oriented programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size grows.</p>
<p> class="black">12) Compiler based:</p>
       <p>C++ is a compiler based programming language, it means without compilation no C++ program can be executed. First we need to compile our program using compiler and then we can execute our program.</p>
<p class="black">C++ Program</p>
<p>
Before starting the abcd of C++ language, you need to learn how to write, compile and run the first C++ program.
To write the first C++ program, open the C++ console and write the following code:

#include <iostream.h>  
#include<conio.h>  
void main() {  
   clrscr();  
   cout << "Welcome to C++ Programming.";   
   getch();  
}  

#include<iostream.h> includes the standard input output library functions. It provides cin and cout methods for reading from input and writing to output respectively.
#include includes the console input output library functions. The getch() function is defined in conio.h file.
void main(): The main() function is the entry point of every program in C++ language. The void keyword specifies that it returns no value.
cout << "Welcome to C++ Programming." is used to print the data "Welcome to C++ Programming." on the console.
getch() : The getch() function asks for a single character. Until you press any key, it blocks the screen.

<p class="black">C vs C++</p>
<p>
1)	C follows the procedural style programming.	C++ is multi-paradigm. It supports both procedural and object oriented.
2)	Data is less secured in C.	In C++, you can use modifiers for class members to make it inaccessible for outside users.
3)	C follows the top-down approach.	C++ follows the bottom-up approach.
4)	C does not support function overloading.	C++ supports function overloading.
5)	In C, you can't use functions in structure.	In C++, you can use functions in structure.
6)	C does not support reference variables.	C++ supports reference variables.
7)	In C, scanf() and printf() are mainly used for input/output.	C++ mainly uses stream cin and cout to perform input and output operations.
8)	Operator overloading is not possible in C.	Operator overloading is possible in C++.
9)	C programs are divided into procedures and modules	C++ programs are divided into functions and classes.
10)	C does not provide the feature of namespace.	C++ supports the feature of namespace.
11)	Exception handling is not easy in C. It has to perform using other functions.	C++ provides exception handling using Try and Catch block.
