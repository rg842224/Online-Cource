<h1 class="center">C#</h1>
<p class="black">What is C#</p>
<p>
C# is pronounced as "C-Sharp". It is an object-oriented programming language provided by Microsoft that runs on .Net Framework.
By the help of C# programming language, we can develop different types of secured and robust applications:
⦁	Window applications
⦁	Web applications
⦁	Distributed applications
⦁	Web service applications
⦁	Database applications etc.
C# is approved as a standard by ECMA and ISO. C# is designed for CLI (Common Language Infrastructure). CLI is a specification that describes executable code and runtime environment.
C# programming language is influenced by C++, Java, Eiffel, Modula-3, Pascal etc. languages.

<p class="black">C++ vs C#</p>
<p>
There are many differences and similarities between C++ programming language and C#. A list of top differences between C++ and C# are given below:
No.	C++	C#
1)	C++ is a general purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural and generic programming.	C# is pronounced as "C-Sharp". It is an object-oriented programming language provided by Microsoft that runs on .Net Framework.
2)	In C++, multiple inheritance is possible through class.	In C#, multiple inheritance is not possible through class.
3)	In C++, memory management is handled manually.	In C#, memory management is handled automatically.
4)	In C++, pointers can be used anywhere in a program.	In C#, pointers can be used only in unsafe mode.
5)	C++ programming is based on OOPs concept.	C# programming is based on Component and OOPs concept.
6)	C++ is a programming language that runs on all platforms.	C# is a programming language that rarely used outside Windows.
7)	C++ programming can be used to create console applications.	C# programming can be used to create console applications, Windows applications, Mobile applications, etc.

<p class="black">Java vs C#
</p>
<p>There are many differences and similarities between Java and C#. A list of top differences between Java and C# are given below:
No.	Java	C#
1)	Java is a high level, robust, secured and object-oriented programming language developed by Oracle.	C# is an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on .Net Framework.
2)	Java programming language is designed to be run on a Java platform, by the help of Java Runtime Environment (JRE).	C# programming language is designed to be run on the Common Language Runtime (CLR).
3)	Java type safety is safe.	C# type safety is unsafe.
4)	In java, built-in data types that are passed by value are called primitive types.	In C#, built-in data types that are passed by value are called simple types.
5)	Arrays in Java are direct specialization of Object.	Arrays in C# are specialization of System.
6)	Java does not support conditional compilation.	C# supports conditional compilation using preprocessor directives.
7)	Java doesn't support goto statement.	C# supports goto statement.
8)	Java doesn't support structures and unions.	C# supports structures and unions.
9)	Java supports checked exception and unchecked exception.	C# supports unchecked exception.

<p class="black">C# Features</p>
<p>
1.	Simple
2.	Modern programming language
3.	Object oriented
4.	Type safe
5.	Interoperability
6.	Scalable and Updateable
7.	Component oriented
8.	Structured programming language
9.	Rich Library
10.	Fast speed
</p>

<p class="black">1) Simple</p>
<p>C# is a simple language in the sense that it provides structured approach (to break the problem into parts), rich set of library functions, data types etc.</p>
<p class="black">2) Modern Programming Language</p>
<p>C# programming is based upon the current trend and it is very powerful and simple for building scalable, interoperable and robust applications.</p>
<p class="black">3) Object Oriented</p>
<p>C# is object oriented programming language. OOPs makes development and maintenance easier where as in Procedure-oriented programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size grow.</p>
<p class="black">4) Type Safe</p>
<p>C# type safe code can only access the memory location that it has permission to execute. Therefore it improves a security of the program.</p>
<p class="black">5) Interoperability</p>
<p>Interoperability process enables the C# programs to do almost anything that a native C++ application can do.</p>
<p class="black">6) Scalable and Updateable</p>
<p>C# is automatic scalable and updateable programming language. For updating our application we delete the old files and update them with new ones.</p>
<p class="black">7) Component Oriented</p>
<p>C# is component oriented programming language. It is the predominant software development methodology used to develop more robust and highly scalable applications.</p>
<p class="black">8) Structured Programming Language</p>
<p>C# is a structured programming language in the sense that we can break the program into parts using functions. So, it is easy to understand and modify.</p>
<p class="black">9) Rich Library</p>
<p>C# provides a lot of inbuilt functions that makes the development fast.</p>
<p class="black">10) Fast Speed</p>
<p>The compilation and execution time of C# language is fast.</p>
