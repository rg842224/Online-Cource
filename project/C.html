<h1><center><u>C Programming Language</u></center></h1>
<body bgcolor="lightblue"><h3><b>C Programming</b></h3>
<br>The C Language is developed for creating system applications that direct interacts to the hardware devices such as drivers, kernals etc.
<br>C programming is considered as the base for other programming languages, that is why it is known as mother language.
<br>It can be defined by following ways:
 <br>1. Mother language
 <br>2. System programming language
 <br>3. Procedure-oriented programming language
 <br>4. Structured programming language
 <br>5. Mid level programming language
<h3><b>1) C as a Mother Language</b></h3>
<br>C language is considered as the mother language of all the modern languages because most of the compilers, JVMs, Kernals etc. are written in C language and most of languages follows c syntax e.g. C++, Java etc.
<br>It provides the core concepts like array, functions, file handling etc. that is being used in many languages like C++, java, C# etc.
<h3><b>2) C as a System Programming Language</b></h3>
<br>A system programming language is used to create system softwares. C language is a system programming language because it can be used to do low level programming (e.g. driver and kernel). It is generally used to create hardware devices, OS, drivers, kernels etc. For example, linux kernel is written in C.
<br>It can't be used in internet programming like java, .net, php etc.
<h3><b>3) C as a procedural language</b></h3>
<br>A procedure is known as function, method, routine, subroutine etc. A procedural language specifies a series of steps or procedures for the program to solve the problem.
<br>A procedural language breaks the program into functions, data structures etc.
<br>C is a procedural language. In C, variables and function prototypes must be declared before being used.
<h3><b>4) C as a structured programming language</b></h3>
<br>A structured programming language is a subset of procedural language. Structure means to break a program into parts or blocks so that it may be easy to understand.
<br>In C language, we break the program into parts using functions. It makes the program easier to understand and modify.
<h3><b>5) C as a mid-level programming language</b></h3>
<br>C is considered as a middle level language because it supports the feature of both low-level and high level language. C language program is converted into assembly code, supports pointer arithmetic (low level), but it is machine independent (feature of high level).
<br>Low level language is specific to one machine i.e. machine dependent. It is machine dependent, fast to run. But it is not easy to understand.
<br>High Level language is not specific to one machine i.e. machine independent. It is easy to understand.

<h3><b>Functions in C</b></h3>
<br>The function in C language is also known as procedure or subroutine in other programming languages.To perform any task, we can create function. A function can be called many times. It provides modularity and code reusability.

<h3><b>Advantage of functions in C</b></h3>
<br>There are many advantages of functions.
<br>1) Code Reusability:
     By creating functions in C, you can call it many times. So we don't need to write the same code again and again.
<br>2) Code optimization:
     It makes the code optimized, we don't need to write much code.
<p>Suppose, you have to check 3 numbers (781, 883 and 531) whether it is prime number or not. Without using function, you need to write the prime number logic 3 times. So, there is repetition of code.
But if you use functions, you need to write the logic only once and you can reuse it several times.</p>
<h3><b>Types of Functions</b></h3>
<br>There are two types of functions in C programming:
<br>Library Functions:  are the functions which are declared in the C header files such as scanf(), printf(), gets(), puts(), ceil(), floor() etc.
<br>User-defined functions: are the functions which are created by the C programmer, so that he/she can use it many times. It reduces complexity of a big program and optimizes the code.
<b>Declaration of a function</b>
<br>The syntax of creating function in c language is given below:

<br>return_type function_name(data_type parameter...){  
//code to be executed  
<br>}  
<br>Return Value:
<br>A C function may or may not return a value from the function. If you don't have to return any value from the function, use void for the return type.
<br>Let's see a simple example of C function that doesn't return any value from the function.
<br>Example without return value:

<br>void hello(){  
<br>printf("hello C");  
<br>}  
<br>If you want to return any value from the function, you need to use any data type such as int, long, char etc. The return type depends on the value to be returned from the function.

<br>Let's see a simple example of C function that returns int value from the function.
<br>Example with return value:

<br>int get(){  
<br>return 10;  
<br>}  
<br>In the above example, we have to return 10 as a value, so the return type is int. If you want to return floating-point value (e.g. 10.2, 3.1, 54.5 etc), you need to use float as the return type of the method.

<br>float get(){  
<br>return 10.2;  
<br>}  
<br>Now, you need to call the function, to get the value of the function.
<br>Parameters in C Function
<br>A C function may have 0 or more parameters. You can have any type of parameter in C program such as int, float, char etc. The parameters are also known as formal arguments.
<br>Example of a function that has 0 parameter:
<br>void hello(){  
<br>printf("hello c");  
<br>}  
<br>Example of a function that has 1 parameter:

<br>int cube(int n){  
<br>return n*n*n;  
<br>}  
<br>Example of a function that has 2 parameters:

<br>int add(int a, int b){  
<br>return a+b;  
<br>}  
<h3><b>Calling a function in C</b></h3>
<p>If a function returns any value, you need to call function to get the value returned from the function. The syntax of calling a function in c programming is given below:
variable=function_name(arguments...);</p>  
<br>1) variable: The variable is not mandatory. If function return type is void, you must not provide the variable because void functions doesn't return any value.
<br>2) function_name: The function_name is name of the function to be called.
<br>3) arguments: You need to provide arguments while calling the C function. It is also known as actual arguments.
