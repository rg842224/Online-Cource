<br>JavaScript for beginners and professionals is a solution of client side dynamic pages.
<br>JavaScript is an object-based scripting language that is lightweight and cross-platform.
<br>JavaScript is not compiled but translated. The JavaScript Translator (embedded in browser) is responsible to translate the JavaScript code.
<br>Where JavaScript is used
<br>JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:
<br>o	Client-side validation
<br>o	Dynamic drop-down menus
<br>o	Displaying data and time
<br>o	Displaying popup windows and dialog boxes (like alert dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt dialog box)
<br>o	Displaying clocks etc.
<h3><b>JavaScript Functions</b></h3>
<br>JavaScript functions are used to perform operations. We can call JavaScript function many times to reuse the code.
<br>Advantage of JavaScript function
<br>There are mainly two advantages of JavaScript functions.
<br>1.	Code reusability: We can call a function several times so it save coding.
<br>2.	Less coding: It makes our program compact. We don’t need to write many lines of code each time to perform a common task.
<h3><b>JavaScript Loops</b></h3>
<br>The JavaScript loops are used to iterate the piece of code using for, while, do while or for-in loops. It makes the code compact. It is mostly used in array.
<br>There are four types of loops in JavaScript.
<br>1.	for loop
<br>2.	while loop
<br>3.	do-while loop
<br>4.	for-in loop
  <br><b>1) JavaScript For loop</b>
<br>The JavaScript for loop iterates the elements for the fixed number of times. It should be used if number of iteration is known. The syntax of for loop is given below.
<br>1.	for (initialization; condition; increment)  
<br>2.	{  
<br>3.	    code to be executed  
<br>4.	}  
<br>Let’s see the simple example of for loop in javascript.
<br>1.	for (i=1; i<=5; i++)  
<br>2.	{  
<br>3.	document.write(i + "<br/>")  
<br>4.	}  
<br>Output:
<br>1
<br>2
<br>3
<br>4
<br>5
<br><b>2) JavaScript while loop</b>
<br>The JavaScript while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times. It should be used if number of iteration is not known. The syntax of while loop is given below.
<br>1.	while (condition)  
<br>2.	{  
<br>3.	    code to be executed  
<br>4.	}  
<br>Let’s see the simple example of while loop in javascript.
<br>1.	var i=11;  
<br>2.	while (i<=15)  
<br>3.	{  
<br>4.	document.write(i + "<br/>");  
<br>5.	i++;  
<br>6.	}  
<br>Output:
<br>11
<br>12
<br>13
<br>14
<br>15
<br><b>3) JavaScript do while loop</b>
<br>The JavaScript do while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times like while loop. But, code is executed at leastonce whether condition is true or false. The syntax of do while loop is given below.
<br>1.	do{  
<br>2.	    code to be executed  
<br>3.	}while (condition);  
<br>Let’s see the simple example of do while loop in javascript.
<br>1.	var i=21;  
<br>2.	do{  
<br>3.	document.write(i + "<br/>");  
<br>4.	i++;  
<br>5.	}while (i<=25);  
<br>Output:
<br>21
<br>22
<br>23
<br>24
<br>25
<br><b>4) JavaScript for in loop</b>
<br>The JavaScript for in loop is used to iterate the properties of an object.
