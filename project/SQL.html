<body bgcolor="lightblue"><h3><b>What is SQL</b></h3>
<br>o	SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
<br>o	It is designed for managing data in a relational database management system (RDBMS).
<br>o	It is pronounced as S-Q-L or sometime See-Qwell.
<br>o	SQL is a database language, it is used for database creation, deletion, fetching rows and modifying rows etc.
<br>o	SQL is based on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus.
<br>All DBMS like MySQL, Oracle, MS Access, Sybase, Informix, Postgres and SQL Server use SQL as standard database language.
<h3><b>Why SQL is required</b></h3>
<br>o	To create new databases, tables and views
<br>o	To insert records in a database
<br>o	To update records in a database
<br>o	To delete records from a database
<br>o	To retrieve data from a database
<h3><b>What SQL does</b></h3>
<br>o	With SQL, we can query our database in a numbers of ways, using English-like statements.
<br>o	With SQL, user can access data from relational database management system.
<br>o	It allows user to describe the data.
<br>o	It allows user to define the data in database and manipulate it when needed.
<br>o	It allows user to create and drop database and table.
<br>o	It allows user to create view, stored procedure, function in a database.
<br>o	It allows user to set permission on tables, procedure and view.
<h3><b>SQL Syntax</b></h3>
<br>SQL follows some unique set of rules and guidelines called syntax. Here, we are providing all the basic SQL syntax.
<br>o	SQL is not case sensitive. Generally SQL keywords are written in uppercase.
<br>o	SQL statements are dependent on text lines. We can place a single SQL statement on one or multiple text lines.
<br>o	You can perform most of the action in a database with SQL statements.
<br>o	SQL depends on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus.
<h3><b>SQL statement</b><h3>
<br>SQL statements are started with any of the SQL commands/keywords like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, DROP etc. and the statement ends with a semicolon (;).
<br>Example of SQL statement:
<p>SELECT "column_name" FROM "table_name";  
Why semicolon is used after SQL statements:
Semicolon is used to separate SQL statements. It is a standard way to separate SQL statements in a database system in which more than one SQL statements are used in the same call.
we will use semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.</p>
<h3><b>SQL Commands</b></h3>
<br>These are the some important SQL command:
<br>SELECT: it extracts data from a database.
<br>UPDATE: it updates data in database.
<br>DELETE: it deletes data from database.
<br>CREATE TABLE: it creates a new table.
<br>ALTER TABLE: it is used to modify the table.
<br>DROP TABLE: it deletes a table.
<br>CREATE DATABASE: it creates a new database.
<br>ALTER DATABASE: It is used to modify a database.
<br>INSERT INTO: it inserts new data into a database.
<br>CREATE INDEX: it is used to create an index (search key).
<br>DROP INDEX: it deletes an index.
<h3><b>SQL Data Types</b></h3>
<br>The SQL data type defines a kind of value that a column can contain.
<br>In a database table, every column is required to have a name and a data type.
<br>Data Type varies from database to database. For example, MySQL supports INT but Oracle supports NUMBER for integer values.
<br>These are the general data types in SQL.
<h3><b>SQL Operators</b></h3>
<br>SQL statements generally contain some reserved words or characters that are used to perform operations such as comparison and arithmetical operations etc. These reserved words or characters are known as operators.
<br>Generally there are three types of operators in SQL:
<br>1.	SQL Arithmetic Operators
<br>2.	SQL Comparison Operators
<br>3.	SQL Logical Operators
<h3><b>SQL Arithmetic Operators:</b></h3>
<br>Let's assume two variables "a" and "b". Here "a" is valued 50 and "b" valued 100.
<br>+	It is used to add containing values of both operands	a+b will give 150
<br>-	It subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand	a-b will give -50
<br>*	It multiply both operand?s values	a*b will give 5000
<br>/	It divides left hand operand by right hand operand	b/a will give 2
<br>%	It divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns reminder	b%a will give 0
<h3><b>SQL Comparison Operators:</b></h3>
<br>Let's take two variables "a" and "b" that are valued 50 and 100.
<br>=	Examine both operands value that are equal or not,if yes condition become true.	(a=b) is not true
<br>!=	This is used to check the value of both operands equal or not,if not condition become true.	(a!=b) is true
<br>< >	Examines the operand?s value equal or not, if values are not equal condition is true	(a<>b) is true
<br>>	Examine the left operand value is greater than right Operand, if yes condition becomes true	(a>b) is not true
<br><	Examines the left operand value is less than right Operand, if yes condition becomes true	(a<="" td="">
<br>>=	Examines that the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand or not,if yes condition become true	(a>=b) is not true
<br><=	Examines that the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand or not, if yes condition becomes true	(a<=b) is true
<br>!<	Examines that the left operand value is not less than the right operand value	(a!<="" td="">
<br>!>	Examines that the value of left operand is not greater than the value of right operand	(a!>b) is true
<h3><b>SQL Logical Operators:</b></h3>
<br>This is the list of logical operators used in SQL.
<br>ALL:	this is used to compare a value to all values in another value set.
<br>AND:	this operator allows the existence of multiple conditions in an SQL statement.
<br>ANY:	this operator is used to compare the value in list according to the condition.
<br>BETWEEN:	this operator is used to search for values, that are within a set of values
<br>IN:	this operator is used to compare a value to that specified list value
<br>NOT:	the NOT operator reverse the meaning of any logical operator
<br>OR:	this operator is used to combine multiple conditions in SQL statements
<br>EXISTS:	the EXISTS operator is used to search for the presence of a row in a specified table
<br>LIKE:	this operator is used to compare a value to similar values using wildcard operator
