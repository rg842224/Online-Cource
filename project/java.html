<h3><b>What is Java?</b></h3><br>

<p>Java is a programming language and a platform.
Java is a high level, robust, secured and object-oriented programming language.
Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has its own runtime environment (JRE) and API,
 it is called platform.
Java Example:
       Let's have a quick look at java programming example. A detailed description of hello Java example is given in next page.
  class Simple
{  
    public static void main(String args[])
  {  
     System.out.println("Hello Java");  
    }  
} </p><br>

	<h3><b>Where it is used?</b></h3><br>
	<p>
	According to Sun, 3 billion devices run java. There are many devices where Java is currently used. Some of them are as follows:
1. Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus etc.
2. Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com etc.
3. Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.
4. Mobile
5. Embedded System
6. Smart Card
7. Robotics
8. Games etc.

	</p><br>

	<h3><b>Types of Java Applications</b></h3><br>
	<p>
	There are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created using java programming:
1) Standalone Application:
     It is also known as desktop application or window-based application. An application that we need to install on every machine such as media player, 
	 antivirus etc. AWT and Swing are used in java for creating standalone applications.
2) Web Application:
     An application that runs on the server side and creates dynamic page, is called web application. Currently, servlet, jsp, struts, jsf etc. technologies 
	 are used for creating web applications in java.
3) Enterprise Application:
     An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications etc. It has the advantage of high level security, load balancing and 
	 clustering. In java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.
4) Mobile Application:
     An application that is created for mobile devices. Currently Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.

	</p><br>
	<h3><b>Java Platforms / Editions</b></h3><br>
	<p>
	There are 4 platforms or editions of Java:
1) Java SE (Java Standard Edition):
     It is a java programming platform. It includes Java programming APIs such as java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math etc. 
	 It includes core topics like OOPs, String, Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, 
	 Collection etc.
2) Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition):
     It is an enterprise platform which is mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications. It is built on the top of Java SE platform. It includes 
	 topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, JPA etc.
3) Java ME (Java Micro Edition):
     It is a micro platform which is mainly used to develop mobile applications.
4) JavaFx:
     It is used to develop rich internet applications. It uses light-weight user interface API.

	<h3><b>Java OOPs Concepts</b></h3><br>
	<p>
	Object Oriented Programming
Advantage of OOPs over Procedure-oriented programming language.
Difference between Objcet-oriented and Objcet-based programming language.
In this page, we will learn about basics of OOPs. Object Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts such as inheritance, data binding, 
polymorphism etc.Simula is considered as the first object-oriented programming language. The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an 
object, is known as truly object-oriented programming language.Smalltalk is considered as the first truly object-oriented programming language.
	</p><br>
	<h3><b>OOPs (Object Oriented Programming System)</b></h3><br>
	<p>
	Java oops conceptsObject means a real word entity such as pen, chair, table etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a 
	program using classes and objects. It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:
1. Object
2. Class
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
5. Abstraction
6. Encapsulation

	</p><br>
	
	<h3><b>Object</b></h3><br>
	<p>
	Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example: chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike etc. It can be physical and logical.
	</p><br>
	
	<h3><b>Class</b></h3><br>
	<p>Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.</p>
	
	<p><b>Inheritance</b></p><br>
	
	<p>
	When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object i.e. known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to 
	achieve runtime polymorphism.
	</p>
	
	<h3><b>Polymorphism</b></h3><br>
	<p>When one task is performed by different ways i.e. known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something e.g. 
	shape or rectangle etc.
    In java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.
	Another example can be to speak something e.g. cat speaks meaw, dog barks woof etc.
</p>
<h3><b>Abstraction</b></h3><br>
<p>Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example: phone call, we don't know the internal processing.
In java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.
</p>

<h3><b>Encapsulation</b></h3><br>
<p>
Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit is known as encapsulation. For example: capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
A java class is the example of encapsulation. Java bean is the fully encapsulated class because all the data members are private here.
</p><br>

<h3><b>Advantage of OOPs over Procedure-oriented programming language</b></h3><br>
<p>1) OPs makes development and maintenance easier where as in Procedure-oriented programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as project 
size grows.
2) OPs provides data hiding whereas in Procedure-oriented programming language a global data can be accessed from anywhere.
3) OPs provides ability to simulate real-world event much more effectively. We can provide the solution of real word problem if we are using the 
Object-Oriented Programming language.
